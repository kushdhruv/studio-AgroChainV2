# **App Name**: AgriChain DApp

## Core Features:

- User Registration & KYC: Allow Farmers, Transporters, Industries, and Government Authorities to register and complete KYC verification, storing data on IPFS and referencing it in the Registration contract. The platform's Admin will then be notified via an admin dashboard to review the request. The Admin will call the Registration.registerParticipant(userAddress, role, metaDataHash) function to officially register and KYC-verify the user on-chain. Registration of each type of user should contain necessary information first before redirecting to dashboard like for farmer he will be asked for Basic Identity Information farmerID ,Unique blockchain address, name, Full legal name, aadhaarNumber, 12-digit Aadhaar (encrypted),mobileNumber, +91-XXXXXXXXXX, emailID, farmer@example.com, dateOfBirth, DD/MM/YYYY, gender, Male/Female/Other ,Farm Details farmLocation.state, State ,farmLocation.district, District name,farmLocation.village, Village name,farmLocation.pincode, 6-digit pincode,farmLocation.gpsCoordinates, Lat, Long, landDetails.totalLandArea ,In acres,landDetails.landOwnershipType,Owned/Leased/Sharecropping, Crop & Waste Information cropDetails.primaryCrops, ["Rice", "Wheat"], cropDetails.croppingSeason, Kharif/Rabi/Zaid, wasteGeneration.wasteTypes, ["Paddy straw"],wasteGeneration.averageWasteQuantity, Tonnes per season,wasteGeneration.currentDisposalMethod,Burning/Composting/Selling so like basic important info and farm details will be asked during signup only , crop info will be asked when he clicks on add shipment . if clicked on Transporter he will be asked for Driver Information driverID, Unique blockchain address,name, Full name,aadhaarNumber, Encrypted Aadhaar, mobileNumber, +91-XXXXXXXXXX,licenseNumber, Driving license number, Vehicle & Business Details vehicleInfo.registrationNumber, Vehicle registration,vehicleInfo.vehicleType, Truck/Tractor,vehicleInfo.capacity, Load in tonnes,businessDetails.transportCompany, Company name (if employed),businessDetails.serviceAreas, ["Districts/States covered"],businessDetails.ratePerKm, Transportation charges so like basic important info will be asked during signup only , otherinfo will be asked when he on dashboard maybe . if clicked on industry he will be asked forCompany Basic Information companyID, Unique blockchain address,companyName, Legal company name,companyType, Private/Public/Cooperative/FPO,incorporationNumber, CIN/Registration number,gstNumber, 15-digit GST number,contactEmail, business@company.com Business Operations processingCapacity, Tonnes per day wasteRequirements.wasteTypes, ["Paddy straw"],wasteRequirements.quantity, Monthly requirement in tonnes Financial & Compliance bankAccountDetails, Primary payment account same goes for it.

- Shipment Creation (NFT Minting): Enable farmers to list new produce/waste, uploading details and photos to IPFS and minting an NFT (ShipmentToken) representing the shipment. Use a unique bytes32 shipmentId generated by the front-end (e.g., ethers.utils.formatBytes32String("SHIP-123")).
- Marketplace: Display all open shipments in a searchable and filterable marketplace, allowing industries to browse and select shipments.
- Escrow Payment System: Facilitate secure payments from industries to farmers and transporters via an EscrowPayment contract, with automatic split payments based on predefined percentages.
- Transporter Weighment and State Updates with Oracle Verification: Enable transporters to submit weighment proofs and update shipment states using a trusted Oracle for signature verification.
- Dispute Resolution: Allow KYC-verified participants to raise disputes, freeze funds in escrow, and enable authorized resolvers to review evidence and resolve disputes.
- Government Oversight Dashboard: Provide a global view of all shipments on the platform with search, filter, and history tracking for Government Authorities. AI tool that provides alerts when there are anomalies (e.g., route deviation, state update patterns that differ substantially from other routes in similar circumstances.)

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant, earthy green (#8FBC8F) to represent agriculture and growth.
- Background color: A light, desaturated green (#F0F8F0), creating a clean and calming backdrop.
- Accent color: A warm, analogous yellow-orange (#D2691E) to highlight key actions and information, evoking a sense of harvest and completion.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' sans-serif for headings and key text to align with art and design, pairing 'Alegreya' serif for body text.
- Use clear, representational icons to depict user roles, shipment states, and actions.
- Employ a clean and intuitive layout, with clear calls to action and role-based dashboards for easy navigation.
- Use subtle transitions and loading animations to provide a smooth user experience.
